sahiltinky94@gmail.com_1 -> Perform the assignment task 1. Replace Tfidfvectorizer instead of CounteVectorizer in text feature only.

sahiltinky94@gmail.com_2 -> Perform the assignment task 2. After tfidfvectorizer, perform SelectKBest with k=1000 features.

sahiltinky94@gmail.com_3 -> Perform the assignment task 3. Countvectorizer teachnique perform on Text feature with unigram and bigram and apply logistic regression classifier both (with class balance and no class balance)

sahiltinky94@gmail.com_4 -> Perform the assignment task 4. I got the as min as possible (logoss = 1.09). I perform various feature engineering like selectkbest with manually hyperparameter for choosing k, tfidfvectorizer with manually hyperparameter of ngram range and max features , tfidfw2v. So, I got as min as possible, by applying tfidfvectorizer with min df=3 and including unigram, bigram,trigram and 4-gram and take max feature=100000.

Note: I have written conclusion on each file at the end of cell and also shown the result in tabular form
